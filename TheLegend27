What are you guys playing?

I'm supposed to be playing Game Of War™ but this one player keeps kicking my ass.

Is it TheLegend27?!

Yeah, TheLegend27.

Who is the legend 27?

Some say TheLegend27 is the first Game Of War™ player ever.

Born from fire.

I heard, TheLegend27 can hurl a boulder farther than a catapult.

I heard TheLegend27 once defeated an entire army with a single blow.

But the worst part is, just when you think you're safe, just when you think you might escape...

WHAM!!! Just like that!
